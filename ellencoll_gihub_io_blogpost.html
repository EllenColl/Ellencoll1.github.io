Over the course of the past few days I have made some progress in my interactive programming project. I have been able to code my animated character, Kristen, to:
<br/>
-	Walk left and right with her using walk cycle frames sequence. Her walk cycle is accessed when the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard have been pressed down.
-	To stop frozen in time of her walk cycle when the left or right arrow keys on the keyboard have been let go. 
-	Keep Kristen frozen at the start of the game so she doesnâ€™t immediately begin her cycle until an arrow key on the keyboard is pressed down.
<br/>
I faced a few challenges during this time. I tried to find appropriate solutions to overcome each obstacle.

There were a few incidents where I would have code saved on Adobe Flash, and it would crash or become corrupt when I would try to re-access and edit it. I resolved to make a new .ai and .as file and then re upload my animated character to a new flash file. 
It became apparent that I should also have several back ups in several different digital locations  (i.e. Memory sticks, computer desktops, School K drive etc.) to make sure I would always have a version that I could come back to view if another incident occurred. 
<br/>
I found it beneficial to write down all of my code and document different changes I made before I saved it so I could easily re write the code if some was lost. It also made it easier to spot mistakes in my code when it was written down rather than trying to spot a problem on a monitor screen.
<br/>
There were no problems in making my walk from left to write automatically on the screen. The problem came when I to program her stop on default or when the arrow keys were let go.
The problem was fixed when I examined previous labs I had completed, asking my teacher fro assistance and examining notes on Moodle. I was able to see where my coding was going wrong and correct the mistakes found in my code.

Here is a .swf of my project so far:
